Following his [CO2 backflow diagnosis](1.%20CO2%20backflow%20diagnosis%20-%20Eli%20Silver.md), Eli Silver conducted some testing with revised components. Everything appears to be working well.  Eli recorded a video showing the system in action so you can see how it all comes together:

The parts used in this test are:
- [CO2 Regulator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP98JBCL/?coliid=I31R3M4KGH3J9Q&colid=3BA60TTIEFPNP&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1)
- [1/4" NPT F to M needle valve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNRTHBX/?coliid=I1Q3WKAYTHH755&colid=3BA60TTIEFPNP&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- [Three way solenoid valve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWDR2L7S/?coliid=I1AJR5OT4AT4H5&colid=3BA60TTIEFPNP&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- [push to connect fitting kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DM1YXHDL/?coliid=I1MDEH4TOK2VHL&colid=3BA60TTIEFPNP&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- A 1/4" NPT M to M adapter 
- Some fittings to adapt the push to connect tubing to a hose barb

As shown in the video, using the 1/4" NPT M to M fitting with the needle valve Eli chose allows the entire system to be rigidly mounted to the pressure regulator. Our regulator has a 1/4" NPT F output which seems quite standard. To simplify the system for a next iteration, Eli would buy a needle valve with 1/4" NPT M to M fittings, allowing the needle valve to attach directly to the regulator without the need for the M to M adapter. We also do not need to use the push to connect flexible tubing between the different components, eliminating the need for the tubing kit entirely. The 1/4" NPT F output of the solenoid valve needs to be adapted to the silicone tubing you are already using, probably with a barb or luer-lok fitting.

With these changes, Eli's recommendation for an Aseptic electroPioractor with intermittent sparging would be:
- [CO2 Regulator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP98JBCL/?coliid=I31R3M4KGH3J9Q&colid=3BA60TTIEFPNP&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1) (or something equivalent that will interface directly with the valve on your CO2 tank)
- [1/4" NPT M to M needle valve](https://www.amazon.com/PIC-NV-B-1-4-MXM-Needle-Connection/dp/B00FBQ2GKU/ref=sr_1_26?crid=3C0XM6BVH5WXO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.e941u_ZLkt4bY2D7gFl6Yuz84_kGJ7Hi0unmSKY-9WsXh82NY-am_Zx078V3wIbkVhm1v-tkH-lRBCDeJImar-Bs2unWY_cv1QgsJAim4fVADk1ac2tXlDOYwJnPiy2cL8f_hECZP2Kc4QPl1FCRfmYEDZJlF4KhLyb6rNQFrSxgYgsRXGI5_9vbZ4u7TLF-qsIrP6tXTvsvWGV20PECkA.dQMoPJa9E4P5p4miZbGMn0O4SZKxKrYL1QCAJDxU4rU&dib_tag=se&keywords=1%2F4%22%2BM%2Bto%2BM%2Bneedle%2Bvalve&qid=1760045559&sprefix=1%2F4%2Bm%2Bto%2Bm%2Bneedle%2Bvalve%2B%2Caps%2C82&sr=8-26&xpid=eTh1TG8Rgj-c_&th=1)
- [Three way solenoid valve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWDR2L7S/?coliid=I1AJR5OT4AT4H5&colid=3BA60TTIEFPNP&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- A 1/4" NPT F to barb or luer-lok fitting that matches your tubing

For assembly, some things to look out for are:
- Apply teflon tape to all threaded connections.
- Attach the needle valve to the solenoid valve "P" port. (You can't turn the needle valve if the vent is in place)
- Attach the output barb to the solenoid valve "A" port. 
- Attach the sintered brass vent to the solenoid valve "R" port, or just leave it open up to you.
- Then attach the entire assembly to the regulator by threading the needle valve input to the regulator output.

To adjust the pressure and flow rate, Here is the procedure Eli followed:
- Open the needle valve all the way.
- Leaving the needle valve open, increase the regulator pressure until the solenoid valve opens reliably when current is applied.
- Open the solenoid valve either by applying constant current to the solenoid or pressing and rotating the blue manual valve trigger on the solenoid valve body.
- While the solenoid valve is open, tighten the needle valve until you achieve the desired flow rate. 
- Test that the solenoid valve still opens when current is applied. If it is not opening reliably, increase the regulator pressure further.
