# electroPioreactor

The electroPioreactor is a [Pioreactor](https://pioreactor.com) adapted to incorporate electrolysis and CO2 sparging.  The main motivation is to facilitate affordable, safe, local production of Hydrogen Oxidising Bacteria (HOB) as a sustainable alternative protein.

More details, including a Bill of Materials for the original electroPioreactor can be found at [AMYBO.org/docs/electroPioreactor/](https://amybo.org/docs/electropioreactor/)

Components, including our parametric [Vial Cap](Components/Vial%20Cap/) design, are detailed [here](Components).

This repo also contains summary outputs of past research projects including [Harvey Mudd](Past%20research/HMC%20Final%20Outputs)'s anode and valve optimisation work and Brown's [CO2 sparger backflow solution](Past%20research/1.%20CO2%20backflow%20diagnosis%20-%20Eli%20Silver.md).

## Aseptic electroPioreactor

A current focus is development and testing of an Aseptic electroPioreactor to facilitate research on monocultures. [Imperial College](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.billerbeck/grants) and [Edinburgh University](https://biology.ed.ac.uk/chris-french-laboratory) are leading this work under [CARMA Hub Pump Priming](https://carmahub.co.uk/about-us/pump-priming-projects/#:~:text=Affordable%20Aseptic%20Electro-Bioreactor%20for%20Reproducible%20Hydrogen%20Oxidising%20Bacteria%20(HOB)%20Research) funding.
