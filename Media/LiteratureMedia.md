# Media for HOB fermentation with in-culture electrolysis
## Literature found
The following papers have been found which give media compositions for fermentation of hydrogen oxidising bacteria (HOB) using in-culture electrolysis.  We are not considering fermentation where H2 is supplied from a source external to the culture, as we believe the impact of ionic strength on electrolysis is significant and that chlorides will also adversely impact HOB (through biocidal hypochlorous acid formation) and electrode impacts.  We have likewise excluded formulations for Photoelectroautotrophic growth and Microbial Electrochemical Recovery Cells.

### Original formulations
1. [Liu et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf5039) detailed Minimal Medium (36 mM phosphate buffer) and high salt version (108 mM) for R. eutropha.
2. [Sydow et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.201600252) focused on the design and characterization of a new minimal medium to enable fast electroautotrophic growth of Cupriavidus necator in microbial electrosynthesis.
3. [Al Rowaihi et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196079) customized nitrogen- and trace metal-deprivation media used for electrochemical formate generation.
4. [Feng et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1254451) developed specialized high-ionic-strength medium (180 mM phosphate buffer) to enrich halotolerant HOB strains.
