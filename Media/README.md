# Media for HOB fermentation with in-culture electrolysis

## Background

We require a long shelf life, relatively easy to formulate, optimal minimal media for Hydrogen Oxidising Bacteria (HOB) fermentation that is also appropriate for use as an electrolyte when producing hydrogen and oxygen for HOB via electrolysis within the culture.  

While many standard and optimised formulations exist for general HOB fermentation, most contain compounds that would have deleterious consequences when subject to electrolysis, for example, gassing off as chlorine, ammonia, etc.

[LiteratureMedia.md](LiteratureMedia.md) discusses over 10 papers describing media used specifically for HOB fermentation with in-culture electrolysis.  Of these it explains the selection of [Sydow et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.201600252) as the basis for our media formulation. [MediaFormulation.md](MediaFormulation.md) goes on to explain how we derived the following longer shelf life formulation from this:

## Trace elements

### Mineral solution

| Component | Formula | Concentration (g/L H₂O) |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Manganese(II) sulfate monohydrate | MnSO₄·H₂O | 2.4 |
| Zinc sulfate heptahydrate | ZnSO₄·7H₂O | 2.4 |
| Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate | CuSO₄·5H₂O | 0.48 |
| Sodium molybdate dihydrate | Na₂MoO₄·2H₂O | 1.8 |
| Nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate | NiSO₄·6H₂O | 1.5 |
| Cobalt(II) sulfate heptahydrate | CoSO₄·7H₂O | 0.0402 |

### Iron solution

| Component | Formula | Concentration (g/L in 0.2 M H₂SO₄) |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate | FeSO₄·7H₂O | 15.0 |

### Storage and shelf life

We anticipate that, if refrigerated at 4°C in amber bottles, the mineral solution may last >5 years, and the acidified iron solution >3 years if the bottle's head space is purged of oxygen following opening.
