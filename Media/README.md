# Media for HOB fermentation with in-culture electrolysis

## Background

We require a long shelf life, relatively easy to formulate, optimal minimal media for hydrogen-oxidising bacteria (HOB) fermentation that is also appropriate to use as an electrolyte for in-culture electrolysis to generate hydrogen and oxygen for HOB.  

While many standard and optimised formulations exist for general HOB fermentation, most contain compounds that would have deleterious consequences when subject to electrolysis, for example, evolving chlorine, ammonia, etc.

[LiteratureMedia.md](LiteratureMedia.md) discusses over 10 papers describing media used specifically for HOB fermentation with in-culture electrolysis.  Of these it explains the selection of [Sydow et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.201600252) as the basis for our media formulation. [MediaFormulation.md](MediaFormulation.md) goes on to explain how we derived the longer shelf life trace element solution below from this.

## Macronutrients

| Component | Formula | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Oxygen | O2 | electrolysis of water |
| Hydrogen | H2 | electrolysis of water |
| Carbon Dioxide | CO2 | sparged from Sodastream cylinder |

## Micronutrients / Trace Element Solution

The trace element solution is made up in batches, at concentrations such that a few drops are added to a batch of macronutrient solution.

### Mineral solution

| Component | Formula | Concentration (g/L H₂O) |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Sodium molybdate dihydrate | Na₂MoO₄·2H₂O | 1.8 |
| Zinc sulfate heptahydrate | ZnSO₄·7H₂O | 2.4 |
| Manganese(II) sulfate monohydrate | MnSO₄·H₂O | 2.4 |
| Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate | CuSO₄·5H₂O | 0.48 |
| Nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate | NiSO₄·6H₂O | 1.5 |
| Cobalt(II) sulfate heptahydrate | CoSO₄·7H₂O | 0.040 |

### Iron solution

| Component | Formula | Concentration (g/L in 0.2 M H₂SO₄) |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate | FeSO₄·7H₂O | 15.0 |

### Storage and shelf life

We anticipate that, if refrigerated at 4 °C in amber bottles (kept dark), the mineral solution may remain stable for multiple years (target >5 years), and the acidified iron solution for >3 years if the bottle headspace is purged with an inert gas (e.g. N₂ or Ar) after opening.
