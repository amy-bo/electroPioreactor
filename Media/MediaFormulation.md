# Media for HOB fermentation with in-culture electrolysis

## Literature

We describe in [LiteratureMedia.md](LiteratureMedia.md) why we selected [Sydow et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.201600252) as the basis of our formulation and its reported shelf-life issue.

## [Sydow et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.201600252) trace-element stock solution

| Component | Formula | Concentration (g/L in 0.1 M HCl) |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate | FeSO₄·7H₂O | 15.0 |
| Manganese(II) sulfate monohydrate | MnSO₄·H₂O | 2.4 |
| Zinc sulfate heptahydrate | ZnSO₄·7H₂O | 2.4 |
| Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate | CuSO₄·5H₂O | 0.48 |
| Sodium molybdate dihydrate | Na₂MoO₄·2H₂O | 1.8 |
| Nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate | NiSO₄·6H₂O | 1.5 |
| Cobalt(II) sulfate heptahydrate | CoSO₄·7H₂O | 0.0402 |

## Long shelf life split solution
In the presence of oxygen at pH >1 Fe²⁺ oxidises rapidly to Fe³⁺ which hydrolyses and precipitates.  Acidification of the solution should slow this. However:
1. Anydrous HCl boils at −85°C, opening the bottle to withdraw solution will both introduce oxygen and allow HCl gas to escape.
2. Cu²⁺ is known to catalyse Fe²⁺ oxidation in oxygen ([Wermink, et al](https://doi.org/10.1080/00986445.2018.1499017)).
3. Other metals are likely to co-precipitate onto/with freshly formed Fe(III) hydroxide/oxyhydroxide ([Gyliene, et al](https://sterc.org/pdf/p1196i.pdf)).
   
This explains the colour change (aqueous Fe²⁺ is green, Fe³⁺ is yellow/red/brown) and precipitation seen at the Holtmann lab.

Segregating iron from the other trace minerals will mean that if it precipitates, only the iron solution needs to be remade.  It can also be made at lower pH, which should reduce precipitation.  H₂SO₄ boils at over 300°C, so it will be less likely to gas off.  It also has a lower pH given the same concentration, and we intend to increase the acid concentration to 0.2M.

## Composition

Given the success reported with use of the [Sydow et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.201600252) minimal medium, we intend to stay as close to its formulation as possible while removing the final chlorides (in the HCl) and separating it into two solutions in order to increase shelf life.

We may compare FeSO₄ stocks acidified with HCl versus H₂SO₄; thereafter we only intend to add more components if we have reason to suspect that they are specifically required by HOB of interest.
