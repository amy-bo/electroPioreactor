# Needle Valves
## Requirement
Most CO2 regulators have insufficient control resolution to be able to precisely control the low gas flow rates required for continuous CO₂ sparging.  Needle valves offer the most accurate flow control.

### Selection criteria
1. **CO₂ compatibility:** All wetted materials must tolerate dry (and ideally also humid) CO₂ exposure without swelling or corrosion.
2. **Wetted materials:** Prefer food-grade, non-cytotoxic materials (e.g. FKM, EPDM, PTFE, PPS, or stainless steel).
3. **Sterilisability:** Ideally capable of cleaning or sterilisation (EtOH, peracetic acid, or autoclave resistance desirable).
4. **Certifications:** CE/UKCA and RoHS compliance required; FDA/EU 1935/2004 desirable.
5. **Form factor:** Compact size for integration with the electroPioreactor system; standard threads to allow short, direct connections to other equipment.
