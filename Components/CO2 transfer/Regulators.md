# Regulators

## Inlet connector
[SodaStream adapters](https://www.co2supermarket.co.uk/category/sodastream-cylinder-adapters-2) tend to cost >£10, so this cost should be taken into consideration when determining whether to use a SodaStream native regulator, or one that comes bundled with a SodaStream adapter.  SodaStream native would be preferable, to minimise the number of connections, reducing bulk, complexity and leak risk.

## Outlet connector
The outlet connector should ideally match the downstream units' connector types for configuration flexibility and minimising the number of unique parts (assuming all parts are female-female and require male-male connectors).  
In order to avoid the need for complex interconnections, if a bubble counter or variable area flow meter (rotameter) is required for flow rate monitoring the outlet will need to be horizontal.

### Other selection criteria
1. **CO₂ compatibility:** All wetted materials must tolerate dry (and ideally also humid) CO₂ exposure without swelling or corrosion.
1. **Wetted materials:** Prefer food-grade, non-cytotoxic materials (e.g. FKM, EPDM, PTFE, PPS, or stainless steel).
1. **Sterilisability:** Ideally capable of cleaning or sterilisation (EtOH, peracetic acid, or autoclave resistance desirable).
1. **Certifications:** CE/UKCA and RoHS compliance required; FDA/EU 1935/2004 desirable.
1. **Form factor:** Compact size for integration with the electroPioreactor system; standard threads to allow short, direct connections to other equipment.
