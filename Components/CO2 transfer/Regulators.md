# Regulators

## Inlet connector
[Sodastream adapters](https://www.co2supermarket.co.uk/category/sodastream-cylinder-adapters-2) tend to cost >Â£10, so this cost should be taken into consideration when determining whether to use a Sodastream native regulator, or one that comes bundled with a Sodastream adapter.  Sodastream native would be preferable, to minimise the number of connections, hence bulk, complexity and potential for leaks.

## Outlet connector
The outlet connector should ideally match the downstream units connectors for configuration flexibility and minimising the number of unique parts (assuming all parts are female-female and require male-male connectors).

## Preferred Option?
[Kegland Mk5 Beverage CO2 Regulator (with included Sodastream adapter)](https://brewkegtap.co.uk/products/new-sodastream-kegland-mk5-beverage-co2-regulator?srsltid=AfmBOoobMTRpV6vxwUH7l_2heci5BtLtWX2f6uNH4RyX184RTBbr6M0V)
### Outstanding questions
1. What is the connector to and from the globe valve?
2. Can the gauges be rotated to a vertical orientation?
