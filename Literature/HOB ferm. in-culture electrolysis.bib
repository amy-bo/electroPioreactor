  abstract = {With global CO2 emissions at their highest in several years, mitigation and possibly reduction of greenhouse gas buildup and concomitant production of renewable fuel molecules for growing transportation fuel needs are urgent challenges for renewable energy scientists and engineers. Knallgas bacteria provide a biocatalyst platform for utilization of CO2 and production of diverse and some high-energy density biofuel molecules, requisite for drop-in transportation fuels. The most well-studied Knallgas bacterium, Ralstonia eutropha, has been engineered to produce n-butanol, isobutanol, and terpene molecules under chemolithoautotrophic conditions. There are other representatives of this group of bacteria that potentially have the capabilities for CO2-based fuel molecule synthesis. In principle, fermentative production of biofuel from CO2 could rival the ``power-to-gas'' (non-biological production of fuels using CO2 and H2) production methods. However, challenges remain for both methods in order to compete with currently priced petroleum-based fuels. With continued streamlining of processes and attention to Industrial Ecology principles, biofuel synthesis by Knallgas bacteria could represent a viable part of a nation's energy portfolio.},

Bioelectrochemical system (BES) driven by clean electric energy has been regarded as a promising way for Cupriavidus necator to produce SCP from CO2 directly. At present, the key problem of culturing C. necator in BES is that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in cathode chamber are harmful to bacterial growth. Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution to mitigate the negative effect of ROS. In this study, we constructed a number of C. necator strains displayed with superoxide dismutase (SOD), which allowed the decomposition of superoxide anion radical. The effects of promoters and signal peptides on the cell surface displayed SOD were analyzed. The proteins displayed on the surface were further verified by the fluorescence experiment. Finally, the growth of C. necator CMS incorporating a pBAD-SOD-E-tag-IgA{$\beta$} plasmid could achieve 4.9\,{\textpm}\,1.0 of OD600 by 7~days, equivalent to 1.7\,{\textpm}\,0.3~g/L dry cell weight (DCW), and the production rate was 0.24\,{\textpm}\,0.04~g/L/d DCW, around 2.7-fold increase than the original C. necator CMS (1.8\,{\textpm}\,0.3 of OD600). This study can provide an effective and novel strategy of cultivating strains for the production of CO2-derived SCP or other chemicals in BES.},

  abstract = {Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising technology to reduce carbon dioxide using inward electron transfer mechanisms to synthesize value-added chemicals with microorganisms as electrocatalysts and electrons from cathodes as reducing equivalents. To enhance CO2 assimilation in Ralstonia eutropha, a formate dehydrogenase (FDH) assisted MES system was constructed, in which FDH catalyzed the reduction of CO2 to formate in the cathodic chamber. Formate served as the electron carrier to transfer electrons derived from cathodes into R. eutropha. To enable efficient formation of formate from CO2, neutral red (NR) was used to facilitate the extracellular regeneration of NADH, the cofactor of FDH. Meanwhile, NR also played an essential role as electron shuttle to directly deliver electrons from cathodes into R. eutropha to increase the level of intracellular reducing equivalents, thus facilitating the efficiency of MES. On the other hand, the Calvin--Benson--Bassham (CBB) cycle was further engineered by the heterologous expression of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in R. eutropha, which strengthened the CBB pathway for CO2 fixation. Upon application of the cathode potential at -0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in the MES system with the genetically engineered R. eutropha, 485 {\textpm} 13 mg/L poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) was obtained, which was {$\sim$}3 times that synthesized by the control (165 {\textpm} 8 mg/L), i.e., the wild-type R. eutropha in the absence of FDH and NR.},

Thereby, catholyte with the high formate concentration of 441{\textpm}9 mmol L-1 was generated as feedstock without intermediate downstream processing for semi-automated formate feeding into a fed-batch reactor system. Moreover, microbial formate conversion to PHB was studied further, optimised, and successfully scaled from shake flasks to semi-automated bioreactors. Therein, a PHB per formate ratio of 16.5{\textpm}4.0 mg g-1 and a PHB synthesis rate of 8.4{\textpm}2.1 mg L-1 OD-1 h-1 were achieved. By this process combination, an almost doubled overall process yield of 22.3{\textpm}5.5 \% was achieved compared to previous reports.

  abstract = {Two sources of oxygen for man in closed-cycle space system environment have been considered in previous studies: (1) photosynthesis using algae, and (2) electrolysis of water. The latter system appears to be the most promising from the standpoints of energy and weight requirements and ability to operate in a zero gravity field. The surplus hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water may be utilized together with waste carbon dioxide, part of the oxygen, and waste urea by bacteria of the genus Hydrogenomonas to produce cellular protein which might be used as a source of food. A continuous culture system for the propagation of hydrogen-fixing bacteria consists of a baffled borosilicate glass culture vessel provided with an impeller, a reservoir vessel for the culture medium, and an overflow vessel for collecting the bacterial cells removed from the culture vessel. Complete feedback control of all parameters affecting growth can be provided by hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors, and a pH electrode in the culture medium. In addition, total pressure is monitored. Cell density is controlled in the optimum range by means of a photoelectric cell which dictates the amount of fresh medium to be added and the amount of cells to be removed. Operating data indicate that some of the key parameters are the ratio of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in solution. The harvested bacterial substance is high in protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.},

However, scaling up of this process requires overcoming the inherent constraints of the low energy efficiency partly associated with the pH-neutral electrolyte with low conductivity. Most of the research in the field is concentrated on the bacterial cultivation, whereas the analysis and evaluation of the electrode material performance have received little attention in the literature so far. Therefore, in the present work, in situ electrolysis of a pH-neutral medium for HOB cultivation was performed with different combinations of electrode materials. Besides conventional electrode types, electrodes with coatings made of earth-abundant cobalt and a nickel-iron alloy, known for their catalytic activity for the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were prepared and tested as potential substitutes for catalysts made of precious metals. The cultivation of HOB with in situ water electrolysis has been successfully tested in a small scale electrobioreactor in order to support the experimental results. A simplified water electrolysis model was developed and applied to evaluate the current-voltage characteristics of an bioelectrochemical system prototype. Application of the developed model allows quantitative evaluation and comparison of reversible, ohmic, and activation overvoltages of different electrode sets. The modeling results were found to agree well with the experimental data. The developed model and the data gathered can be applied to further investigation, simulation, and optimization of HBI systems.},

The limits for the susceptibility of the bacterium to the oxidizing agents were established. The rate of accumulation of the oxidizing agents and formation of the cathode deposit were found to depend on the current density, the pH and composition of a solution, and several other factors. The concentration of hypochlorite decreased if the content of chloride ions in the growth medium was reduced to approximately 10(-5) g/l; the concentrations of persulfate and hydrogen peroxide is decreased using a certain electrolysis regime and adding ferrous ions which reduce the oxidizing agents. The cathode deposit is dissolved by periodically reversing the current in the course of electrolysis.},

We were able to demonstrate that the use of flue gas as a CO2 source has no detectable negative effect on bacterial growth and PHB production in comparison to a pure gas mixture. In an electrochemical H-cell 333 {\textpm} 44\,mg\,L-1 PHB were obtained, which corresponds to a PHB content of 43 {\textpm} 3\,\% of the cell dry weight. By using flue gas for the production of the biopolymer PHB, not only CO2 emissions are reduced, but also possible environmental pollution from non-biodegradable plastics.

Nevertheless, the characteristics of electrode-associated cells in MES and their metabolic pathway regulation in CO2 fixation have not been elucidated. This study examined the electrode-driven polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from CO2 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The electron uptake and regulation of the metabolic pathways differed in electrode-associated and suspended R. sphaeroides. The electrode-associated cells produced PHB at concentrations up to 23.50~{\textpm}~2.8\% of the dry cell weight (DCW), whereas the suspended cells grew faster but with a lower cellular PHB content. Gene expression analyses showed that phaA expression was upregulated in electrode-associated R. sphaeroides, whereas phaB expression was downregulated in suspended cells. The electrode-associated cells expressed unconventional CO2 fixation enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, with more PHB synthesis. These results show that CO2 can be upcycled to polymeric substances and provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of electrode-associated cells in MES.},

Current methods, such as chemical batteries, hydraulic pumping, and water splitting, suffer from low energy density or incompatibility with current transportation infrastructure. Here, we report a method to store electrical energy as chemical energy in higher alcohols, which can be used as liquid transportation fuels. We genetically engineered a lithoautotrophic microorganism, Ralstonia eutropha H16, to produce isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol in an electro-bioreactor using CO2 as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input. The process integrates electrochemical formate production and biological CO2 fixation and higher alcohol synthesis, opening the possibility of electricity-driven bioconversion of CO2 to commercial chemicals.},

  abstract = {The production of edible microbial biomass in bioreactors is an attractive alternative to agriculture, which is a major consumer of fresh water, an emitter of greenhouse gases, and a cause of eutrophication. This study examines microbial food production by gas fermentation of two endotoxin-free Gram-positive H2-oxidizing autotrophic bacterial strains, Nocardioides nitrophenolicus KGS-27 and Rhodococcus opacus DSM 43205. The supply of the gaseous substrates H2 and O2 by in situ water electrolysis was investigated as an alternative to providing them from an external source. N. nitrophenolicus KGS-27 produced {$\leq$}9.9 {\textpm} 2.0 mg of biomass L--1 h--1 and was not affected by in situ water electrolysis, which potentially produces growth-inhibiting reactive oxygen species. With R. opacus DSM 43205, in turn, electrolysis slowed growth considerably and resulted in a volumetric productivity of 2.6 {\textpm} 0.8 mg of biomass L--1 h--1, which was a quarter of what was obtained with the gases supplied externally. The macromolecular compositions of biomasses produced by the two cultivation modes using the two bacterial strains were rather similar containing approximately 33--37\% protein, 28--56\% carbohydrates, and 4--5\% fatty acids of the cell dry weight. Relatively high protein concentrations and balanced amino acid profiles, comparable to those of casein and soy protein, were achieved with both strains.},

In particular, cropland-based production of protein-rich animal feed for livestock rearing results in large-scale agricultural land-expansion, nitrogen pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we propose and analyze the long-term potential of alternative animal feed supply routes based on industrial production of microbial proteins (MP). Our analysis reveals that by 2050, MP can replace, depending on socio-economic development and MP production pathways, between 10--19\% of conventional crop-based animal feed protein demand. As a result, global cropland area, global nitrogen losses from croplands and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased by 6\% (0--13\%), 8\% (-3--8\%), and 7\% (-6--9\%), respectively. Interestingly, the technology to industrially produce MP at competitive costs is directly accessible for implementation and has the potential to cause a major structural change in the agro-food system.},

It provided agriculture with reactive nitrogen and ultimately mankind with nourishment for a population of 7 billion people. However, the present agricultural practice of growing crops for animal production and human food constitutes a major threat to the sustainability of the planet in terms of reactive nitrogen pollution. In view of the shortage of directly feasible and cost-effective measures to avoid these planetary nitrogen burdens and the necessity to remediate this problem, we foresee the absolute need for and expect a revolution in the use of microbes as a source of protein. Bypassing land-based agriculture through direct use of Haber Bosch produced nitrogen for reactor-based production of microbial protein can be an inspiring concept for the production of high quality animal feed and even straightforward supply of proteinaceous products for human food, without significant nitrogen losses to the environment and without the need for genetic engineering to safeguard feed and food supply for the generations to come.},

Electrochemically-assisted batch fermenters were operated in galvanostatic mode to examine the impact of current density (0.0 -- 1.0 mA{$\cdot$}cm- 2) on bacterial growth. The results revealed a linear increase in volumetric biomass productivity rate with the increment in current density. At the high current densities tested (1.0 mA{$\cdot$}cm- 2), the more elevated growth and ammonium removal rates were achieved (473 {\textpm} 164 mgTSS{$\cdot$}L- 1{$\cdot$}d- 1 and 93 {\textpm} 39 mgN{$\cdot$}L- 1{$\cdot$}d- 1, respectively). Adjusting the current density allowed for the pro\- duction of biomass with high hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen yields, indicating the influence of H2 availability on these values (up to 2.6 gTSS{$\cdot$}gH2- 1 and 6.9 gTSS{$\cdot$}gN- 1, respectively). This study confirms the potential of the electro-microbial platform in recovering and transforming nutrients, particularly nitrogen, into microbial biomass that can be utilised as edible protein or organic fertiliser. The findings highlight the viability of this approach for achieving efficient nitrogen assimilation and biomass production, offering promising prospects for addressing nitrogen utilisation challenges in conventional agro-systems.},

The modality of hydrogen production/supply to HOBs represents a challenge. In this work, bioelectrochemical hydrogen and oxygen productions were coupled with HOBs cultivation in the same reactor. Using this approach, the protein content was 59 {\textpm} 8\% with Hydro\- genophaga and Xanthobacter as the most abundant HOBs. Biomass concentration was found to be dependent of the current density with bulk liquid biomass increasing between 101 and 124 mg TSS{$\cdot$}L- 1 for an increase of 0.1 mA{$\cdot$}cm- 2. Electrodes directly immersed in the bioreactor promoted biofilm formation on the electrode surface, which could become an attractive alternative for biomass harvesting.

Growth conditions were tested with either ammonium chloride or dinitrogen gas as the nitrogen source. Although TIE-1's capacity to produce PHBs varied fairly under different conditions, photoelectroautotrophy and photoferroautotrophy showed the highest PHB electron yield and the highest specific PHB productivity, respectively. Gene expression analysis showed that there was no differential expression in PHB biosynthesis genes. This suggests that the variations in PHB accumulation might be post-transcriptionally regulated. This is the first study to systematically quantify the amount of PHB produced by a microbe via photoelectroautotrophy and photoferroautotrophy. This work could lead to sustainable bioproduction using abundant resources such as light, electricity, iron, and carbon dioxide.},

The PHB belongs to the family of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) that mostly accumulates as a granule in the cytoplasm of microorganisms to store carbon and energy. In this study, we established an integrated one-pot electromicrobial setup in which carbon dioxide is reduced to formate electrochemically, followed by sequential microbial conversion into PHB, using the two model strains, Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 and Cupriavidus necator H16. This setup allows to investigate the influence of different stress conditions, such as coexisting electrolysis, relatively high salinity, nutrient limitation, and starvation, on the production of PHB. The overall PHB production efficiency was analyzed in reasonably short reaction cycles typically as short as 8 h. As a result, the PHB formation was detected with C. necator H16 as a biocatalyst only when the electrolysis was operated in the same solution. The specificity of the source of PHB production is discussed, such as salinity, electricity, concurrent hydrogen production, and the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS).},

It was shown that both the introduction of a plasmid vector and exposure to the corresponding antibiotic selection pressure caused a strong improvement in both cathodic biofilm formation and electrochemical properties. A quantitative proteomic analysis identified key players in the molecular adaptation to biofilm growth on the cathodic surface. Furthermore, biofilm formation kinetics were quantified by optical coherence tomography measurements, which showed a strong tendency for biofilm formation together with a robust biofilm architecture.

Thus, the bio-electro recycling of recalcitrant CO2 as feedstock to produce bioplastics could be an interesting solution to explore. In this work, a bioelectrochemical reactor was used to carry out microbial electrosynthesis (MES) of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from CO2 and then, those VFAs were used to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) by using a pre-selected mixed microbial culture (MMC). During MES (cathode potential at -0.8 V vs. SHE), CO2 fixation efficiency, i.e. carbon (C) transferred to final products was of 73\% CCO2, with a final values of 43.7 and 103 mmol of C produced for acetate and butyrate. The VFAs obtained were extracted and concentrated by liquid membrane extraction getting a broth with a C concentration of approximately 400 mmol C L-1 ({$\sim$}65\% butyrate), to be used as feeding for PHA producing bacteria. During the PHA accumulation a maximum of 74.4 {\textpm} 0 g PHA per 100 g VSS was obtained with a PHA yield (Ytot) of 0.77 {\textpm} 0.18 mmol CPHA mmol-1 Cfed. The process efficiency calculated taking into account the PHA yield on C inlet as CO2 was of 0.50 {\textpm} 0.07 mmol CPHA mmol-1 CCO2. In terms of C conversion, 0.41 kg of carbon as PHA were obtained per 1 kg of carbon as CCO2 inlet to the entire system. These results establish a sustainable way to convert a greenhouse gas as CO2 into environmental friendly bioplastics.},

To maintain global food security in the future, protein production needs to become more efficient regarding the use of limited land and water resources. Protein-rich biomass can be produced via direct air capture of CO2 with the help of H2-oxidizing bacteria and renewable electricity in a closed, climate-independent system. This quantitative literature review conservatively estimated the direct land and water use of bacterial protein production relying on secondary data for the components of the technology and for the reference protein sources. A several times higher potential protein yield per land area can be achieved by this technology with approximately one-tenth of the water use compared to that required for soybean production.},

Reaction media used in such bioelectrochemical systems have to fulfill requirements of classical biotechnology as well as electrochemistry. The design and characterization of a medium that enables fast electroautotrophic growth of Cupriavidus necator in microbial electrosynthesis was investigated in detail. The identified chloride-free medium mainly consists of low buffer concentration and is supplied with trace elements. Biotechnologically relevant parameters, such as high-specific growth rates and short lag phases, were determined for growth characterization. Fast growth under all conditions tested, i.e. heterotrophic, autotrophic and electroautotrophic was achieved. The lag phase was shortened by increasing the FeSO{$_4$} concentration. Additionally, electrochemical robustness of the reaction media was proven. Under reductive conditions, no deposits on electrodes or precipitations in the media were observed and no detectable hydrogen peroxide evolved. In the bioelectrochemical system, no lag phase occurred and specific growth rate of C. necator was 0.09 h{$^{-1}$}. Using this medium shortens seed train drastically and enables fast electrobiotechnological production processes based on C. necator.},

Current solar-to-fuels storage cycles based on water splitting produce hydrogen and oxygen, which are attractive fuels in principle but confront practical limitations from the current energy infrastructure that is based on liquid fuels. In this work, we report the development of a scalable, integrated bioelectrochemical system in which the bacterium Ralstonia eutropha is used to efficiently convert CO2, along with H2 and O2 produced from water splitting, into biomass and fusel alcohols. Water-splitting catalysis was performed using catalysts that are made of earth-abundant metals and enable low overpotential water splitting. In this integrated setup, equivalent solar-to-biomass yields of up to 3.2\% of the thermodynamic maximum exceed that of most terrestrial plants. Moreover, engineering of R. eutropha enabled production of the fusel alcohol isopropanol at up to 216 mg/L, the highest bioelectrochemical fuel yield yet reported by {$>$}300\%. This work demonstrates that catalysts of biotic and abiotic origin can be interfaced to achieve challenging chemical energy-to-fuels transformations.},

  abstract = {Anaerobic digesters produce biogas, a mixture of predominantly CH4 and CO2, which is typically incinerated to recover electrical and/or thermal energy. In a context of circular economy, the CH4 and CO2 could be used as chemical feedstock in combination with ammonium from the digestate. Their combination into protein-rich bacterial, used as animal feed additive, could contribute to the ever growing global demand for nutritive protein sources and improve the overall nitrogen efficiency of the current agro- feed/food chain. In this concept, renewable CH4 and H2 can serve as carbon-neutral energy sources for the production of protein-rich cellular biomass, while assimilating and upgrading recovered ammonia from the digestate. This study evaluated the potential of producing sustainable high-quality protein additives in a decentralized way through coupling anaerobic digestion and microbial protein production using methanotrophic and hydrogenotrophic bacteria in an on-farm bioreactor. We show that a practical case digester handling liquid piggery manure, of which the energy content is supplemented for 30\% with co-substrates, provides sufficient biogas to allow the subsequent microbial protein as feed production for about 37\% of the number of pigs from which the manure was derived. Overall, producing microbial protein on the farm from available methane and ammonia liberated by anaerobic digesters treating manure appears economically and technically feasible within the current range of market prices existing for high-quality protein. The case of producing biomethane for grid injection and upgrading the CO2 with electrolytic hydrogen to microbial protein by means of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria was also examined but found less attractive at the current production prices of renewable hydrogen. Our calculations show that this route is only of commercial interest if the protein value equals the value of high-value protein additives like fishmeal and if the avoided costs for nutrient removal from the digestate are taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {Valorization of CO2 is key to establishing a carbon--neutral society. However, CO2 possesses a strong C~=~O with bond energy of 750~kJ/mol, which makes it difficult for electrochemical conversion. As a result, the conversion of CO2 to complex molecules remains a grand challenge and product profiles based on inorganic catalysis are only limited to a few simple chemicals, such as formate, acetate, and ethanol. Here, we employed microbial electrosynthesis to diversify the product spectrum. First, an engineered Cupriavidus necator strain was constructed to produce lycopene from H2 and CO2. Then, by coupling de novo microbial catalyzed lycopene synthesis with inorganic catalyzed water electrolysis, a microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system was developed. Lycopene, representing the most complex nonnative molecules in the MES system, was produced with CO2 as the sole carbon source and H2 derived from electrochemical water splitting as the reducing power. Moreover, the produced lycopene provided long-term cytoprotective capacity against reactive oxygen species, thereby addressing the incompatibility between microbial and inorganic catalysis. Finally, 1.73~mg/L lycopene was produced from real exhaust gas from a coal-fired power plant in the MES system. The present study opens a possible route to turn trash to cash for industrial exhaust gas.},

  abstract = {Ever-increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have urged the development of efficient CO2 fixation methods. Biotechnical methods using algae and cyanobacteria have been studied, but another alternative could be the use of Knallgas bacteria. Hydrogen-oxidizing Knallgas bacteria are capable of using hydrogen as their energy source and converting CO2 into biomass. Chemolithoautotrophic gas fermentation has been studied in literature to determine the production possibilities of Knallgas bacteria. In a few studies the hydrogen and oxygen have also been produced inside an electrobioreactor, using electrolysis of the culture medium. This work established the cultivation of the Knallgas bacterium Rhodococcus opacus in electrobioreactor conditions. Several 70 ml electrobioreactor cultivations were performed to determine the suitability of the organism to the process. In the first cultivations, using platinum electrodes, it was proven that the organism was able to grow with supply of CO2, while generating hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis of culture medium inside the reactor. Further testing using iridium oxide-coated titanium and stainless steel electrodes enabled to increase electrode surface area and current. In addition, carbonate was added in the medium to decrease the overpotential of electrolysis. Growth-improving factors were concluded to be increased hydrogen formation due to moderately higher current, and increased inoculum growth time under autotrophic conditions. Shake flask cultivations with different substrates showed that chemolithoautotrophic growth was over seven times slower than heterotrophic. Best autotrophic growth in an electrobioreactor was achieved using iridium oxide coated titanium wire as anode and stainless steel as cathode. The applied current was 14 mA in 70 ml culture volume. The maximum cell density was 3.25 g/l. The biomass composition of R. opacus was analysed, and the average protein content was 63 \% of total biomass. The composition was comparable to other single-cell protein sources, as well as soybean, indicating possible uses for animal feed. The biomass-based protein price was calculated to be 3.4 {\texteuro}/kg, based on the electricity consumption alone. Further process improvements and cheaper electricity could result in R. opacus biomass being a viable product alternative for soybean meal as animal feed.},

By integrating the cathode of the electrolyzer with a gas lift reactor, the setup mitigated the inhibition of anodic reactive oxygen species on HOB and enhanced hydrogen utilization efficiency. By gradually increasing the current (1-2-4-6~A), the reactor achieved a maximum biomass yield of 0.20~g cell dry weight/L/d, a protein content of 58.3\%, and a hydrogen utilization efficiency of 100\%. The microbial community was dominated by HOB such as Ancylobacter (74.4\%) and Xanthobacter (8.2\%). These results indicated that the innovative reactor design effectively improved the performance of HOB-SCP production by inorganic-biological hybrid systems.
